# Cybersecurity Incident Report: Data Breach 

This report is part of my coursework for the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. This report analyzes a scenario involving a social media organization that recently experienced a significant data breach due to undetected vulnerabilities. The data breach compromised customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. As a security analyst, the objective is to propose effective network hardening measures to enhance the organization's security posture. The report outlines three key security measures: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Strong Password Policies, and Regular Firewall Maintenance. Each recommendation is supported by an explanation of its importance and effectiveness in mitigating potential future breaches.

## Part 1: Recommended Network Hardening Tools and Methods

To tackle the vulnerabilities discovered in the organization’s network, I recommend implementing the following three security measures:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   MFA adds an essential layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification before they can access applications. This could involve anything from fingerprint scans and ID cards to PIN numbers and traditional passwords. By using MFA, we can greatly reduce the chances of unauthorized access.

2. **Strong Password Policies**  
   Establishing clear and strong password policies is crucial. These should outline requirements for password length, complexity, and discourage practices like password sharing. For example, policies might include rules about acceptable characters and stipulate that accounts are temporarily locked after a specific number of unsuccessful login attempts. This makes it much harder for attackers to guess or brute-force passwords.

3. **Regular Firewall Maintenance**  
   Maintaining firewalls is not a one-time task; it requires regular attention. This includes routinely checking and updating security settings to defend against new threats. Keeping firewall rules up to date helps ensure that only legitimate traffic is allowed while blocking suspicious activity.

## Part 2: Rationale Behind Recommendations

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
Implementing MFA is a game-changer for our security. By requiring more than just a password, we add significant hurdles for anyone attempting to breach the network. This additional verification not only makes unauthorized access more challenging but also reduces the temptation for employees to share passwords, since a shared password alone won’t grant access without the second factor.

### Strong Password Policies  
Robust password policies are essential for enhancing our security posture. By instituting measures such as account locks after failed login attempts, we can effectively mitigate the risk of brute force attacks. Moreover, setting standards for password complexity and requiring regular updates further protects against unauthorized access.

### Regular Firewall Maintenance  
Firewalls serve as the first line of defense against external threats, and regular maintenance is critical to their effectiveness. This means routinely reviewing and updating the firewall’s rules to ensure they align with current security standards. Quick adaptations following any security incidents will help to maintain a secure network and protect against various types of denial-of-service attacks.
