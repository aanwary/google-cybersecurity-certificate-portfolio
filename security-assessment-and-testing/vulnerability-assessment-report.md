# Vulnerability Assessment Report

This project showcases my ability to assess risks and vulnerabilities in IT systems. The report highlights key risks, evaluation methods, and remediation strategies to enhance system security.

## Overview

- **System**: Database Server
- **Purpose**: Evaluate vulnerabilities related to access controls and provide strategies to mitigate risks.
- **Scope**: The server’s access controls were assessed over a three-month period, from June 20XX to August 20XX, guided by principles from **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1**.

## System Description

The server infrastructure features a high-performance CPU and 128GB of RAM, running on the latest version of the Linux operating system. It uses a MySQL database management system to store and manage organizational data. The server operates over a stable network connection configured with IPv4 addresses and supports encrypted communication through SSL/TLS protocols. Additionally, it interacts with other networked servers to facilitate business operations.

## Scope

This vulnerability assessment focuses on the server’s current access controls, examining potential risks to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The evaluation spans a three-month period, from June 20XX to August 20XX, and adheres to the methodologies outlined in NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1.

## Purpose

The company’s database server is a critical resource for storing and managing customer data, campaign analytics, and other essential business information. Employees rely on this system daily to analyze trends and personalize marketing efforts. Given its importance, securing the server is vital to prevent unauthorized access and maintain business continuity. Any compromise of this system could severely disrupt operations and negatively impact the company’s reputation.

## Risk Assessment

### Threat Assessment Table

| **Threat Source** | **Threat Event**                       | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Risk** |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| Hacker             | Extract sensitive data via exfiltration | 3              | 3            | 9        |
| Employee           | Disrupt critical operations            | 2              | 3            | 6        |
| Customer           | Modify or delete critical information  | 1              | 3            | 3        |

### Approach

The risks were evaluated by analyzing the company’s current data storage and management practices, particularly the open-access nature of the database. Threat sources and events were selected based on their potential likelihood and the impact they could have on business operations. The likelihood of an incident was judged using knowledge of similar vulnerabilities, while the severity scores reflect the consequences to daily operations and data integrity if such incidents occur.

## Remediation Strategy

To address these vulnerabilities, the following measures are recommended:  

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement role-based access controls to ensure users have only the permissions necessary for their roles. Enforce strong password policies and deploy multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.  
2. **Auditing and Monitoring**: Introduce regular logging and auditing of access attempts to detect suspicious activities promptly.  
3. **Data Encryption**: Replace outdated SSL protocols with TLS to secure data in motion and prevent interception.  
4. **Network Access Control**: Use IP allow-listing to restrict server access to trusted locations, such as corporate offices.  

By implementing these controls, the company can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and ensure the continued security of its critical systems.
